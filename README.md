## Installation & Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TrinaJinfeng/LovelyFish.git

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd LovelyFish-Backend

3. **Install dependencies and restore NuGet packages:**
  ```bash
  dotnet restore
```

4. **Apply database migrations:**
  ```bash
  dotnet ef database update
```

5. **Run the backend server:**
  ```bash
  dotnet run
```

6. **Open Swagger UI to explore API endpoints:**
  ```bash
  http://localhost:7148/swagger
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Swagger URL is local; production endpoints are protected and require authentication.
```

## üß™ Testing & Environment Differences (Backend)

### 1. Manual API Testing
- **Swagger UI:** After implementing each API endpoint, test manually using Swagger.
  - Examples include: 
    - User registration
    - Product image upload
    - Sending email notifications
- **API Validation:** 
  - Check HTTP status codes (200, 400, 401, etc.)
  - Ensure data consistency and proper error handling

### 2. Database Connection Differences
- **Local SQL Server:** Connection string in `appsettings.Development.json`, tests work normally.
- **Azure SQL:** Connection string stored in environment variables. Sometimes, if not all required environment variables are set, backend throws database connection errors.
- **Solution:** Always configure all required environment variables for both local and cloud environments to ensure consistent connectivity.

### 3. Image Upload Differences
- **Local:** Images uploaded to local `wwwroot/images`, accessed normally.
- **Azure Blob Storage:** Directly using local paths causes 404 errors.
- **Solution:** Backend returns full Blob URLs; frontend uses these URLs directly to ensure images display correctly.

### 4. Email Service Differences
- **Local:** Used SMTP test account, emails sent successfully.
- **Production / Azure:** Initially tried using Brevo with a Zoho domain email. Even with correct DNS and verification, emails went to spam and admin inbox did not receive them.
- **Solution:** Switched to SMTP for sending and receiving emails. Credentials stored in environment variables (never hard-coded) to ensure security.

### 5. Frontend Integration / CORS
- **Local:** Frontend calls `localhost:5000` backend, works normally.
- **Production / Azure:** Backend must allow frontend URL via CORS, otherwise requests are blocked.
- **Solution:** Configure backend CORS to allow the deployed frontend URL.
